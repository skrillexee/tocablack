toca life world build characters

Toca Life World is the perfect game for kids and kids at heart who miss letting their imagination run wild. Before the internet, social media, and other forms of entertainment right now, most kids would just play with toys. Also, they would use their imagination to tell stories or perform actions using their still toys. This educational game by Toca Boca is a fun way to become creative and make your own reality.

In this game, it’s like you are playing with a giant dollhouse, as all the characters here won’t do anything. You can control them, as well as most items and pets that you see in the game. Also, you can make characters hold items, change clothes, and even style their hair. There are even food items that they will eat. What’s great about Toca Life World is that it’s like a culmination of the other Toca Boca games. You can play Toca Office, Toca Hospital, Toca Kitchen, and more in this game.

All of these buildings can be found in Toca Life World, so you will have access to all of them. Basically, your creativity and imagination will be the ones to set the limit on what you can do in this game. Aside from providing a digital dollhouse, Toca Life World includes secrets in the games. In this article, we’ll discuss many of the secrets that you will likely find in this educational game..",

One of the secrets that you can find in Toca Life World is a cool-looking sloth outfit. The outfit can be found at the storage center of Bop City. Once there, just go left until you reach an area where you can see the “No Sloth” poster. Click that poster to reveal the sloth outfit, which is hidden in secret storage behind the poster.
Toca Life World Nari’s Pet Croquet

Another secret thing that you can find in the storage center of Bop City is Nari’s pet named Croquet, It is an adorable cloud-like creature in the game. Once in the storage center, you will instantly see a trail of food crumbs leading to a storage door.

Then, follow the crumbs to the door and open it. Once the door is open, just remove some items to reveal the area where you will place the food bowl. It is an area that is surrounded by food stains. It’s not a hard area to miss, as the floor has the markings of the food bowl. After placing it there, Croquet will instantly appear.",

However, there are crumpets that are quite hard to find in the game. To unlock these crumpets, you will need the characters Zeke, Nari, Rita, and Leon. Also, these characters would need to hold items together at the storage center to reveal the secret crumpets. Below are ways to get them:

First Floor

The first floor of the mall already has many secrets. Go to the far right until you see the pots. Then, at the top there’s a closed cabinet door, open it to reveal the different flowers that are available. Next, go to the ATM located near the flower shop. Below are 3 emojis and you must remember them as they are a code to unlock another secret.

Next, go to the photobooth phone and input the 3 emojis you saw under the ATM machine. This will reveal a secret compartment once you’ve done it. Then, remove the flame gun to see a 3-digit code (218), that you should also remember.
Second Floor

Go to the optician’s office and look for the eye chart. Then, tap the poster to reveal a slot and place the red key card there. Doing this will open a secret room with a safe in it. To open the safe you will need to input a 3-digit code. Input the 3-digit code you saw on the secret compartment on the first floor. Once done, the safe will open and you will see a golden gem and stacks of money.",
